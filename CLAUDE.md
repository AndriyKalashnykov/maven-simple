## Architecture

Two independent module areas under `src/main/java/`:

- **`http/client/`** — Five HTTP client implementations (Java HttpURLConnection, Java HttpClient, Apache HttpClient 5, OkHttp3, Retrofit with Gson converter) with shared models in `model/`
- **`jsonparse/`** — JSON processing examples organized by approach:
  - `treemodels/` — DOM-style parsing (Jackson JsonNode, Gson JsonElement)
  - `databinding/simple/` — POJO mapping with Jackson and Gson
  - `databinding/complex/` — Generated model classes for full NASA NEO response (separate `jackson/generated/` and `gson/generated/` packages)
  - `pathqueries/` — JsonPath and Jackson JsonPointer queries

### Notable design decisions

- **Jackson cross-major split** — `tools.jackson.core:jackson-databind` 3.x reuses the legacy `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations` 2.x coordinate (Jackson 3 didn't move the annotations package). The `jsonparse/databinding/complex/jackson/generated/` POJOs import `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*` — this is intentional, not a migration leftover.

## Testing

Three-layer test pyramid:

| Layer | Target | Discovery | Runtime |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Unit | `make test` | `*Test.java` via `maven-surefire-plugin` | seconds |
| Integration | `make integration-test` | `*IT.java` via `maven-failsafe-plugin` (activated by the `integration-test` Maven profile) | seconds (WireMock in-process) |
| E2E | _N/A_ | Library/demo project — no deployable unit | — |

> **No `e2e` CI job by design.** This project has no service to hit, so `integration-test` (`*IT.java` with WireMock-stubbed upstream) is the canonical end-of-pipeline test. Per `/ci-workflow` skill, the `e2e` requirement does not apply to libraries/demos with no deployable unit.

JUnit 6 tests in `src/test/java/` mirror the main source structure. **`make test` is fully offline** — no live network. The HTTP-client coverage is split two ways:

- **`*IT.java`** (failsafe) — the asserting integration layer: each of the five clients (`JavaHttpUrlConnectionIT`, `JavaHttpClientIT`, `ApacheHttpClientIT`, `OkHttpClientIT`, `RetrofitClientIT`) drives the real client + JSON parse into `Page`/`User` against an in-process [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) stub and asserts the parsed response shape + the rate-limited (429) error path. `OkHttpClientIT.java` is the reference pattern.
- **`*DemoTest.java`** (surefire) — offline smoke of each `*Demo.main()` against the same in-process WireMock stub, so the demo wiring is covered by `make test` without a live call. The demos' request target is injected via the **`articleUsersUrl`** / **`articleUsersBaseUrl`** system properties (or the `ARTICLE_USERS_URL` / `ARTICLE_USERS_BASE_URL` env vars), defaulting to the live `jsonmock.hackerrank.com` API when run directly (`java … <Demo>`).

The `jsonparse/**` tests (surefire) run each parsing demo against the committed local `source.json` and assert the real computed values (NEO count 101, 19 hazardous, fastest NEO). Coverage enforced at 70% via JaCoCo plugin (`jacoco:check`).

## Static Analysis

`make static-check` is the composite fast quality gate and runs in CI:

- `check-toolchain-alignment` — fails fast if the Java major disagrees across `.java-version`, `.mise.toml`, and `pom.xml` (runs first; see Upgrade Backlog note on the untracked Java pin)
- `format-check` — [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) drift detection
- `lint` — `mvn validate` + `mvn compile` with `failOnWarning=true`
- `secrets` — [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) scan for hardcoded secrets
- `trivy-fs` — [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) filesystem scan for vuln/secret/misconfig (CRITICAL/HIGH fails build; MEDIUM informational)
- `mermaid-lint` — [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) validates Mermaid blocks in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` (Docker-based)
- `deps-prune-check` — fails the build on declared-but-unused Maven dependencies (`mvn dependency:analyze-only -DfailOnWarning`)

Run `make format` to auto-apply google-java-format. `cve-check` (OWASP dependency-check) is kept separate — it runs on release tags (`v*`) because of its long runtime.

## Key Config

- **pom.xml** — maven-enforcer-plugin requires Maven 3.6.3+ and Java 25+; JaCoCo 70% threshold; compiler `failOnWarning` enabled; Jackson 3.x (`tools.jackson.core`); OWASP dependency-check bound to build lifecycle (skip with `-Ddependency-check.skip=true`); Failsafe plugin activated via `-P integration-test` profile
- **.mise.toml** — single source of truth for Java (Temurin 25 LTS), Maven 3.9.16, and aqua-backed pins for `act`, `gitleaks`, `trivy`; auto-installed by `make deps`. CI provisions the toolchain via [`jdx/mise-action`](https://github.com/jdx/mise-action). The Makefile's matching `_VERSION` constants are derived at parse time via `$(shell awk ...)` so the curl fallbacks (`deps-maven` / `deps-act` / `deps-gitleaks` / `deps-trivy`) used by `act` runners without mise read the same version mise installs locally.
- **.java-version** — secondary source of truth (IDE integration); `.mise.toml` is authoritative for build/CI. NOTE: the `.mise.toml` `java` pin (`temurin-25.0.3+9.0.LTS`) is **not auto-bumped by Renovate** — the mise LTS value format is not version-comparable by either the `custom.regex` manager or Renovate's native `mise` manager (empirically verified: both report `unsupported/unversioned value`). Java is therefore bumped manually across all three files (`.java-version`, `.mise.toml`, `pom.xml`); the `make check-toolchain-alignment` guard (first step of `static-check`) fails the build if any of the three drifts, so a partial bump cannot silently split the toolchain.
- **.nvmrc** — Node version for Renovate tooling (`make renovate-bootstrap`)
- **renovate.json** — Automated dependency PRs with automerge on all update types. `platformAutomerge` is intentionally `false` (not a deviation): the branch ruleset requires the `ci-pass` check, and GitHub-native auto-merge can complete in the ~1s window before `ci-pass` registers — landing a red bump. With `platformAutomerge: false` Renovate merges via its own run after re-confirming green. A `pinDigests: false` rule scoped to `custom.regex`+`docker` keeps `config:best-practices`' `docker:pinDigests` from colliding with (and silently dropping) the `MERMAID_CLI_VERSION` bump. `RENOVATE_VERSION` in the Makefile tracks the `npm` datasource (not `github-releases`) because Renovate's GitHub releases run ~8 versions ahead of npm publishes; `npx renovate@<ver>` resolves via npm. Detection: `make renovate-validate` failing with `npm error notarget No matching version found for renovate@<ver>` means the datasource is mismatched.
- **CI pipeline** — `changes` (path-filter detector via `dorny/paths-filter`) → `static-check` → `test` + `integration-test` + `build` (parallel); `cve-check` on release tags, weekly schedule (Mon 06:00 UTC), and manual dispatch, with NVD database cache; `ci-pass` gate aggregates all required jobs for branch protection (skipped doc-only jobs count as pass). Required GitHub secrets (set in Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions): `NVD_API_KEY`, `OSS_INDEX_USER`, `OSS_INDEX_TOKEN` — without `NVD_API_KEY` the tag-gated `cve-check` will hit NVD rate limits and fail.

## Upgrade Backlog

Items genuinely waiting on upstream — Renovate cannot bump these until the upstream channel makes them available.

- Renovate was **reactivated 2026-06-29** after a ~Apr–Jun outage (Mend app had been uninstalled/suspended; during the gap, drop-in bumps were applied manually via `/ship-it`). The bot is live again and producing correctly-grouped PRs — `renovate.json` config (`platformAutomerge:false`, the `pinDigests:false` rule, the renovate self-throttle, and the Jackson / SLF4J / Apache-HttpClient / Maven-Plugins / Makefile-tool-versions groups) is now active and auto-merges on green `ci-pass`. No manual dependency sweeps needed going forward. Still held (pre-release, Renovate skips via `ignoreUnstable`): maven-compiler-plugin 4.0.0-beta, maven-resources-plugin 4.0.0-beta, SLF4J 2.1.0-alpha, WireMock 4.0-beta, jackson-annotations 3.0-rc; Java stays 25 LTS (26 is non-LTS).
- [ ] `jdk.incubator.vector` is still an incubator module as of Java 25 (still incubating in JEP 510 / 8th-round). The `--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector` flag in the `cve-check` recipe is required because OWASP dependency-check's bundled Lucene uses the Vector API. Drop the flag once Vector is promoted out of incubator (expected Java 26+).
- [ ] `maven.compiler.failOnWarning=true` will make JDK deprecation warnings upgrade-blocking on future LTS bumps (Java 29+). Plan a targeted deprecation audit before each LTS bump.
- [ ] JsonPath 3.1 not yet released — latest GA is `3.0.0` (2026-02-22). Watch release notes for behavioural changes that may affect `jsonparse/pathqueries/` when it ships.
- [ ] Pre-release deps awaiting GA: SLF4J 2.1.0 (alpha), `maven-compiler-plugin` 4.0.0 (currently `beta-4`), `maven-resources-plugin` 4.0.0 (currently `beta-1`). Adopt after GA. SLF4J 2.0.x is on latest GA. (JUnit reached GA and was bumped to 6.1.1 this session.)
